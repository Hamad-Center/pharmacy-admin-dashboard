# Validation & Form Reset Testing Guide

## 🎯 Quick Start

The admin dashboard now has **complete inline validation** and **automatic form reset** for all creation forms. Here's how to test it:

### 1. Open the Dashboard
```bash
# Dashboard should be running at:
http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Login
- Use your super admin credentials
- You'll be redirected to the dashboard

### 3. Test Each Page

#### 🏢 Tenants Page
1. Click "Create Tenant" button
2. **Verify empty form** - all fields should be blank
3. Click "Create Tenant" without filling anything
4. **See inline errors** - red borders and error messages under each required field
5. Start typing in Name field
6. **Error disappears** - as soon as you type, the error clears
7. Fill all fields correctly
8. **Success** - tenant created, dialog closes
9. Reopen "Create Tenant"
10. **Form is empty again** - ready for next tenant

**Validation Rules to Test:**
- Empty name → "Tenant name is required"
- Name too short (e.g., "A") → "Tenant name must be at least 2 characters"
- Empty code → "Tenant code is required"
- Code too short → "Code must be at least 3 characters"
- Invalid code format (e.g., "ABC123") → "Code must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens"
- Valid code format: `test-tenant-123`
- Invalid email → "Please enter a valid email address"

#### 👥 Users Page
1. Click "Add User" button
2. **Verify empty form** - all fields blank
3. Try submitting without filling anything
4. **See inline errors** on all required fields
5. Test password field specifically:
   - Type "weak" → Shows error about requirements
   - When no error, shows gray helper text with password rules
6. Fill all fields with valid data
7. **Success** - user created
8. Reopen "Add User"
9. **Form is empty** - no data from previous user

**Validation Rules to Test:**
- Empty first/last name → "First/Last name is required"
- Names too short → "Must be at least 2 characters"
- Invalid email → "Please enter a valid email address"
- Empty password → "Password is required"
- Short password (e.g., "Pass1!") → "Password must be at least 8 characters"
- Weak password variations:
  - No uppercase → "Password must include uppercase, lowercase, number & symbol"
  - No lowercase → Same error
  - No number → Same error
  - No symbol → Same error
- Valid password examples: `TestUser123!`, `MyPass456@`, `Secure789#`
- No tenant selected → "Please select a tenant"

**Reset Password Dialog:**
1. Click "Reset Password" on any user
2. **Empty password field**
3. Try weak passwords → See inline errors
4. Enter valid password → Success

#### 🏪 Branches Page
1. Click "Create Branch" button
2. **Verify empty form** - all fields blank, dropdowns showing placeholders
3. Try submitting empty form
4. **See inline errors** on all required fields
5. Test phone field specifically - must be Kuwait format
6. Fill all fields correctly
7. **Success** - branch created
8. Reopen "Create Branch"
9. **Form is empty** - ready for new branch

**Validation Rules to Test:**
- Empty name → "Branch name is required"
- Name too short → "Branch name must be at least 2 characters"
- Empty phone → "Phone number is required"
- Invalid phone formats to try:
  - "12345" → "Phone must be in format +965 followed by 8 digits"
  - "+1234567890" → Same error
  - "+96512345" → Same error (not 8 digits)
- Valid phone format: `+96512345678`
- Empty address → "Address is required"
- Address too short (e.g., "Test") → "Address must be at least 10 characters"
- No governorate → "Please select a governorate"
- No city → "Please select a city"

## 📋 Complete Testing Checklist

For comprehensive testing, use the detailed checklist:
```
TESTING_CHECKLIST.md
```

This includes 80+ test cases covering:
- ✅ All validation scenarios
- ✅ Form reset after creation
- ✅ Form reset after cancel
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Network errors
- ✅ Duplicate entries
- ✅ Field interactions

---

## 🔍 Automated Verification

You can run the automated verification script to confirm the implementation:

```bash
cd pharmacy-admin-dashboard
node verify-form-reset.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ All pages have proper form reset mechanisms!

✓ useEffect hooks with dialog open dependencies
✓ Form data reset on dialog open
✓ Error state reset on dialog open
✓ Validation functions implemented
✓ Inline error display
✓ Conditional styling for errors
```

## 📖 Technical Documentation

For implementation details, see:
```
FORM_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md
```

This document includes:
- Complete validation rules reference
- Code patterns used
- Technical architecture
- API endpoints
- Performance considerations
- Accessibility notes

## 🐛 What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs
- Errors appear under fields immediately
- Red borders on invalid fields
- Errors disappear when you start typing
- Forms are empty when opened
- Success messages appear after creation
- New items appear in the table immediately

### ❌ Bad Signs (Report These)
- Errors don't show under fields
- No red borders on invalid inputs
- Errors don't clear when typing
- Forms prefilled with old data
- No success message after creation
- Table doesn't update after creation
- Form doesn't close after success

---

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### Error State
- **Border**: Red (`border-red-500`)
- **Text**: Red, small size (`text-xs text-red-600`)
- **Position**: Directly under the invalid field

### Valid State
- **Border**: Gray (default)
- **Helper Text**: Gray, small size (`text-xs text-gray-500`)
- **Example**: Password field shows requirements in gray

### Focus State
- **Border**: Blue ring on focus
- **Transition**: Smooth color change

## 💡 Tips for Testing

1. **Test one field at a time** - Leave others empty to see specific errors
2. **Try edge cases** - Very long inputs, special characters, etc.
3. **Test rapid changes** - Type fast, see if errors update correctly
4. **Test dialogs multiple times** - Open, close, reopen to verify reset
5. **Test after successful creation** - Verify form resets completely
6. **Test with real data** - Use realistic tenant names, emails, etc.

## 🚀 Next Steps After Testing

Once testing is complete:

1. ✅ Mark any issues found
2. ✅ Verify all test cases pass
3. ✅ Proceed to create Pharmacies page
4. ✅ Apply same validation patterns
5. ✅ Complete Settings page redesign
6. ✅ Final integration testing

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the error messages in browser console
2. Verify network requests in Network tab
3. Check backend logs for API errors
4. Review validation patterns in the code
5. Consult FORM_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md for details
